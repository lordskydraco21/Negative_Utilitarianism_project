Here’s the information organized into a **table format** for clarity and comparison:

| **Philosophy**   | **Core Idea**                                                                 | **Key Thinkers/Works**                          | **Ethical Basis**                                                                 | **Criticisms**                                                                 | **Connection to NU**                                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Antinatalism**  | Procreation is immoral; existence imposes suffering without consent.          | David Benatar (*Better Never to Have Been*)<br>Julio Cabrera | Asymmetry Argument (non-existence avoids pain but lacks no pleasure).<br>Consent Argument. | Accused of pessimism.<br>Practical challenges (e.g., societal collapse).       | Targets the **source** of suffering (birth).              |
| **Promortalism**  | Death is preferable to life; ending existence eliminates suffering.           | Less associated with specific thinkers.         | Suffering outweighs happiness; nonexistence is better than suffering.             | Ethically monstrous if applied non-voluntarily.<br>Ignores will to live.       | Targets the **continuation** of suffering (life).         |
| **Efilism**       | Advocates extinction of all sentient life to permanently end suffering.       | Inmendham (Gary Mosher)                         | Life inherently involves predation and suffering.<br>NU + ecological pessimism.   | Accused of misanthropy.<br>Logistically unworkable (e.g., who enacts extinction?). | Targets the **universal substrate** of suffering (life).  |

### **Key Notes**  
- **NU = Negative Utilitarianism** (prioritizes suffering reduction).  
- All three philosophies radicalize NU but differ in scope:  
  - **Antinatalism**: Stop new life.  
  - **Promortalism**: End existing life.  
  - **Efilism**: Eliminate life itself.  
- Shared criticisms include moral extremism, consent violations, and practical infeasibility.
