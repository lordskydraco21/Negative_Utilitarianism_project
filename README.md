Negative Utilitarianism (NU) is a philosophical theory emphasizing the reduction of suffering as the primary moral imperative. Below is an organized list of key ideas, sub-theories, and related concepts within or associated with NU:

### Core Principles of Negative Utilitarianism
1. **Minimization of Suffering**: The central tenet is that reducing suffering holds greater moral urgency than promoting happiness.
2. **Asymmetry Thesis**: Suffering and happiness are not morally symmetrical; preventing suffering is more critical than creating pleasure.
3. **Strong vs. Weak NU**:
   - **Strong NU**: Advocates for eliminating suffering as the sole moral obligation, even if it requires extreme measures (e.g., human extinction).
   - **Weak NU**: Prioritizes reducing suffering but allows for promoting happiness as a secondary goal.

### Key Philosophical Arguments and Concepts
4. **Hedonistic Imperative** (David Pearce): A techno-ethical framework to abolish suffering via biotechnology, blending NU with transhumanism.
5. **Antinatalism**: Argues against procreation to prevent potential suffering, often aligned with NU (e.g., works of Julio Cabrera or David Benatar).
6. **S-Risks (Suffering Risks)**: Focus on preventing risks of astronomical-scale suffering, such as dystopian AI scenarios.
7. **Extinction Risk Debate**: Controversial argument that human/biological extinction might be justified to eliminate suffering (criticized as the "world destruction" objection).

### Applications and Ethical Implications
8. **Animal Rights**: Advocacy for reducing suffering in industrial farming and wildlife (e.g., effective altruist projects).
9. **AI Ethics**: Ensuring AI systems prioritize harm prevention, addressing misalignment risks.
10. **Medical Ethics**: Emphasis on palliative care and euthanasia to alleviate suffering.

### Related Movements and Criticisms
11. **Effective Altruism**: NU influences prioritization of causes like global health or factory farming to efficiently reduce suffering.
12. **Buddhist Ethics**: Parallels with the goal of ending suffering (dukkha), though differing in metaphysical foundations.
13. **Criticisms**:
    - **Paradox of Happiness**: If reducing suffering is paramount, could suppressing happiness-generating activities (e.g., risky sports) be justified?
    - **Utility Monster Reversed**: A "suffering monster" might demand disproportionate resources, challenging NU's practicality.

### Notable Thinkers and Works
14. **Karl Popper**: Suggested minimizing suffering as a societal goal in *The Open Society and Its Enemies*.
15. **Magnus Vinding**: Explores NU in *Suffering-Focused Ethics*, addressing practical implications.
16. **Arthur Schopenhauer**: Although not NU, his pessimism about suffering's prevalence resonates with NU themes.

### Theoretical Extensions
17. **Negative Preference Utilitarianism**: Focuses on avoiding the frustration of preferences (a non-hedonistic NU variant).
18. **Consent-Centric Ethics**: Prioritizes preventing non-consensual harm, often overlapping with NU principles.
19. **Threshold Views**: Argues that extreme suffering cannot be outweighed by any pleasure, demanding absolute priority.

### Conclusion
NU challenges traditional utilitarianism by inverting moral priorities, sparking debates in ethics, policy, and futurism. While its radical conclusions (e.g., extinction arguments) draw criticism, its emphasis on suffering reduction influences diverse fields from animal welfare to existential risk management.
